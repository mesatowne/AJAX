# AJAX
This is an example of using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Actually we use JSON now.) to call data from an API. I am using the AJAX 'GET' method to retreive the data and the AJAX 'PUT' method to enter data back into the API. To see the code working live, use this link -> http://amwebaz.com/Ajax/beverage/AJAX/

In this code I use an Open Source publically available  API.
